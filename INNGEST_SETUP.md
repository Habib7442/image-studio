# Inngest Setup Guide

## Overview
Inngest has been successfully integrated into your Style My Selfie app to provide reliable, background image generation workflows with real-time progress tracking.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Inngest Client & Configuration**
- `lib/inngest/client.ts` - Inngest client with type-safe events
- `lib/inngest/functions.ts` - Workflow functions for image generation and credit management

### 2. **API Routes**
- `app/api/inngest/route.ts` - Inngest webhook endpoint
- `app/api/style-my-selfie/generate/route.ts` - Updated to use Inngest workflows
- `app/api/style-my-selfie/progress/route.ts` - Real-time progress tracking

### 3. **Frontend Updates**
- `app/dashboard/style-my-selfie/page.tsx` - Updated with progress polling and real-time updates

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Inngest CLI (if not already installed)
```bash
npm install -g inngest-cli
```

### 2. Start Inngest Dev Server
In a separate terminal window, run:
```bash
npx inngest-cli@latest dev
```

This will start the Inngest development server at `http://localhost:8288`

### 3. Start Your Next.js App
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 4. Access Inngest Dashboard
Open `http://localhost:8288` in your browser to:
- Monitor workflow executions
- View function runs and logs
- Debug any issues
- Trigger functions manually for testing

## How It Works

### 1. **User Initiates Generation**
- User uploads selfie and enters prompt
- Frontend calls `/api/style-my-selfie/generate`
- API validates input and sends event to Inngest
- Returns immediately with request ID

### 2. **Background Workflow Execution**
- Inngest triggers `generateStyledSelfie` function
- Function executes in steps:
  - Validate user credits
  - Process selfie image
  - Generate AI variations
  - Deduct credits
  - Update progress throughout

### 3. **Real-time Progress Updates**
- Frontend polls `/api/style-my-selfie/progress` every 2 seconds
- Progress updates show current step and percentage
- User sees real-time status: "Validating credits...", "Generating AI variations...", etc.

### 4. **Completion Handling**
- When generation completes, progress API returns final result
- Frontend displays generated images
- Success notification shown to user
- Form is cleared and credits updated

## Benefits of This Implementation

### âœ… **Reliability**
- Built-in retries (3 attempts)
- Durable execution - won't lose progress on failures
- Step-by-step workflow management

### âœ… **User Experience**
- Immediate response (no waiting for generation)
- Real-time progress updates
- Clear status messages
- Better error handling

### âœ… **Scalability**
- Background processing doesn't block API
- Concurrency limits (5 simultaneous generations)
- Easy to add more workflow steps

### âœ… **Monitoring**
- Complete execution history in Inngest dashboard
- Easy debugging and troubleshooting
- Performance metrics

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
UPSTASH_REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_redis_token
```

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start both servers** (Inngest dev server + Next.js)
2. **Go to Style My Selfie page**
3. **Upload a selfie and enter a prompt**
4. **Click "Generate 3 Variations"**
5. **Watch the real-time progress updates**
6. **Check Inngest dashboard** at `http://localhost:8288` to see the workflow execution

## Production Deployment

For production, you'll need to:
1. Deploy your Next.js app
2. Set up Inngest Cloud account
3. Update `NEXTAUTH_URL` to your production domain
4. Configure Inngest webhook URL in your app

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Inngest dev server not running** - Make sure to start it with `npx inngest-cli@latest dev`
2. **Progress not updating** - Check browser console for errors
3. **Generation stuck** - Check Inngest dashboard for failed steps
4. **API errors** - Check Next.js console and Inngest logs

### Debug Steps:
1. Check Inngest dashboard for function runs
2. Look at browser network tab for API calls
3. Check Next.js console for errors
4. Verify environment variables are set

## Next Steps

You can now:
- Add more workflow steps (image compression, storage, etc.)
- Implement email notifications
- Add batch processing
- Create more complex workflows
- Monitor performance and usage

The foundation is solid and ready for production use! ðŸš€
